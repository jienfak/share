#runit is the default init system used by Void Linux. runit is a suite of tools which include a PID 1 init as well as a daemontools-compatible process supervision framework, along with utilities which streamline creation and maintenance of services.
#runit employs a concept of a service directory, responsible for an individual service, which is a process to monitor, and an optional log service. 

# Basic usage
# To start, stop or restart a service, run:
sv up service_name
sv down service_name
sv restart service_name

# To get the current status of a service, run:
sv status service_name

# To get the current status of all enabled services, run:
sv status /var/service/*


# Enabling new services.
# Void Linux provides service directories for most daemons in /etc/sv/. To enable a service,
#	create a symlink to the service directory in /var/service.
# 	This will automatically start the service in your current runlevel.
#	Once a service is linked it will always start on boot
#	and restart if it stops, unless administratively downed.
ln -s /etc/sv/service_name /var/service/

# To keep a enabled service from starting automatically at boot,
#	create a file named down in the service directory.
touch /etc/sv/service_name/down


# Disabling services
#	To disable a service in the current runlevel,
#	remove the symlink to its service directory from /var/service.
rm /var/service/service_name


# Editing services
# To edit a service, first duplicate its service directory under a different name.
cp -aR /etc/sv/service_name /etc/sv/service_name_edited

# The contents of the duplicated directory can then be edited as needed, for example, by using vi(1).
vi /etc/sv/service_name_edited

# After editing, the old service should then be stopped, disabled and replaced with the new one.
sv down service_name
rm /var/service/service_name
ln -s /etc/sv/service_name_edited /var/service/

#The runit-void package currently supports two runlevels: single and default.
#	single: it just runs sulogin(8) and the necessary steps to rescue your system.
#	default: The default run level. default runs all services linked in /var/service/ (aka multi-user).
